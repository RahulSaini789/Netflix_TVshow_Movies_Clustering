Here's a summary of the key steps and decisions made during the project:\n","\n","Data Understanding: The project began with importing the dataset and gaining a basic understanding of its contents. This involved inspecting the dataset's structure, data types, and basic statistics.\n","\n","Data Wrangling: Data preprocessing was planned and executed. The date feature was converted to a pandas datetime object for easier manipulation. Missing values were not handled extensively, as they were limited and did not significantly impact the analysis. The decision was made to utilize the text-based \"Description\" feature for machine learning.\n","\n","Text Preprocessing: Text data preprocessing was performed on the \"Description\" feature. This included converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, stopping words, and extra white spaces. These steps prepared the text for vectorization.\n","\n","Text Vectorization: The TfidfVectorizer was used to convert the preprocessed text data into numerical vectors. A maximum of 400 features were chosen to represent each review observation, providing a 400-length feature vector for each.\n","\n","Clustering Models: Three different clustering models were experimented with:\n","\n","K-means: This is a traditional clustering algorithm that partitions the data into K clusters based on similarity. It was one of the first methods tried.\n","Hierarchical Clustering: Hierarchical clustering arranges data points into a hierarchy of clusters. This approach was explored to understand potential hierarchical relationships in the data.\n","DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that can identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes. It was chosen as another clustering method to compare with K-means and hierarchical clustering.\n","The project aimed to identify meaningful clusters within the Netflix Movies and TV-shows dataset based on the content descriptions. The choice of clustering algorithms allowed for different perspectives on how the data could be grouped."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"},"source":["# **GitHub Link -**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"},"source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"},"source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DpeJGUA3kjGy"},"source":["The dataset under consideration contains information about TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. This dataset was collected from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. In recent years, Netflix has witnessed significant changes in its content library. In 2018, it was reported that the number of TV shows on Netflix had almost tripled since 2010, while the number of movies had decreased significantly.\n","\n","The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix dataset to extract valuable insights and trends. This analysis aims to answer questions and uncover patterns such as:\n","\n","Content Trends: Explore how the quantity of TV shows and movies has evolved over the years. Are there noticeable shifts in the content mix, and what might be the reasons behind these changes?\n","\n","Content Duration: Analyze the distribution of content duration (runtime) for both TV shows and movies. Are there any trends in the length of content?\n","\n","Content Ratings: Investigate the distribution of content ratings (e.g., PG, TV-MA) to understand the diversity of content available on Netflix.\n","\n","Release Year Analysis: Examine the distribution of content release years. Are there patterns in the years when content was added to Netflix?\n","\n","Country of Production: Explore the countries where content is produced. Which countries contribute the most content to Netflix?\n","\n","Content Analysis: Perform a textual analysis of the descriptions to identify common themes or keywords in the content. Are there recurring topics in the descriptions?\n","\n","Integration with External Data: Investigate the possibility of integrating this dataset with external sources, such as IMDb ratings or Rotten Tomatoes scores, to enrich the analysis and gain a deeper understanding of content quality and popularity.\n","\n","The insights derived from this analysis can be valuable for both Netflix and its viewers. Netflix can use these insights to make informed decisions about content acquisition and production. Additionally, viewers can benefit from a better understanding of the content available on the platform, helping them discover shows and movies that align with their preferences.\n","\n","This project offers an opportunity to explore trends in the rapidly evolving world of streaming content and provides a foundation for more advanced analyses and machine learning applications in the future."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mDgbUHAGgjLW"},"source":["# **General Guidelines** : -  "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZrxVaUj-hHfC"},"source":["1.

Various clustering algorithms, such as K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, were applied to group similar content together. The goal is to discover meaningful patterns or groupings within the dataset.\n","\n","* Next Steps:\n","\n","After clustering, the clusters can be analyzed to understand what characteristics define each group of content. Insights from this unsupervised analysis can be used to recommend content to users, personalize user experiences, or aid in content recommendation systems.
